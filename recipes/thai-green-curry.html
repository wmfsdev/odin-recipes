            <h2>Thai Green Curry</h2>
                <p>authentic Thai Green Curry recipe. If you can make a good green curry 
                    then you can pretty much make any kind of Thai coconut based curry. 
                    They are all very similar once you have the basics mastered.</p>

                <h3>Inredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>400 ml Coconut Milk</li>
                        <li>2 tbsp Green Curry Paste</li>
                        <li>300 g Sliced Chicken Breast</li>
                        <li>3 tbsp Fish Sauce</li>
                        <li>50 g Palm Sugar</li>
                        <li>50 g Sliced Aubergine</li>
                        <li>50 g Sliced Green Pepper</li>
                        <li>50 g Sliced Courgettes</li>
                        <li>30 g Mange Tout</li>
                        <li>3 Kaffir Lime Leaves</li>
                        <li>3 Basil Leaves</li>
                        <li>1 Long Red Chilli</li>
                        <li>1 sprig Basil</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Put a quarter of the can of coconut milk in the sauce pan or wok and 
                        let it simmer for a couple of minutes</li>
                        <li>Add your curry paste and stir it into the coconut milk until it's all mixed together.</li>
                        <li>Let it simmer for at least 5 minutes until it becomes fragrant. The longer you leave it 
                        simmering the more flavoursome your curry will be! (This is the most important part of</li>
                        the recipe and many green curries end up tasting terrible because the curry paste isn't 
                        left to simmer for long enough).</li>
                        <li>Add the chicken and stir it into the curry paste until all the chicken is covered.</li>
                        <li>Add the remainder of the coconut milk and turn the heat up and bring it to the boil 
                        before reducing the heat again to let it simmer.</li>
                        <li>Add the sugar and fish sauce.</li>
                        <li>Stir and then taste. (You can add more sugar or more fish sauce if the flavour isn't strong enough).</li>
                        <li>Add the aubergine first (as these take longer to cook)</li>
                        <li>When it begins to boil again you can add the courgettes, baby corn and kaffir lime leaves.</li>
                        <li>Bring it to the boil once more and that's it.</li>
                        <li>Spoon it into a serving bowl and sprinkle with the basil leaves and chilli slices.</li>
                    </ol>
