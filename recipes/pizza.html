                tomato sauce and melted cheese. Here's how to master this everyday classic...</p>

                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <strong>FOR THE DOUGH</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>500g '00' or strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
                                <li>1 sachet (7g) fast-action dried yeast</li>
                         </ul>

                        <strong>FOR THE SAUCE</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>400g can plum tomatoes (San Marzano are the best)</li>
                                <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra to serve</li>
                                <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
                                <li>Small bunch basil, leaves picked, stalks reserved</li>
                            </ul>

                        <strong>FOR THE TOPPINGS</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>50g parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), freshly grated</li>
                                <li>200g mozzarella from a block, cut into chunks</li>
                            </ul>

                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>First, make the dough. Tip the flour into a bowl and add 300ml 
                                    tepid water. Mix together and set aside at room temperature for 1 hr. 
                                    Dissolve the yeast in 2 tbsp water and mix this and 15g of salt through 
                                    the dough. Cover with cling film and leave somewhere warm to double 
                                    in size for a few hours. For a sourer flavour, leave in the fridge for 
                                    at least 8 hrs and up to 24 hrs - the longer you leave it the sourer it will be.</li>
                                                         
                                <li>When the dough is ready, tip it onto a lightly floured surface and divide into four. 
                                    Roll into balls and leave to rest, covered with a tea towel or cling film for another hour.</li>
                         
                                <li>Now make the tomato sauce. Drain some of the juice from the can and tip the rest 
                                    into a bowl with the olive oil, oregano and a generous pinch of salt, then either 
                                    scrunch everything together with your fingers for a chunky sauce or blitz with a 
                                    stick blender if you want it smooth. Tie the basil stalks together, bruise with 
                                    the back of a knife and place in the sauce. Leave the sauce at room temperature 
                                    until needed.</li>
                
                                <li>To make the pizza, heat a grill to its highest setting and get a heavy frying pan. 
                                    On a floured surface push and stretch one of the balls of dough out into a circle 
                                    roughly the same size as the frying pan. Slip the round onto a floured baking sheet
                                    and top with a quarter of the sauce, a scattering of cheese, a few basil leaves and 
                                    a quarter of the mozzarella.</li>
                          
                                <li>Get the pan very hot and carefully slide the pizza onto it. Cook for 2 mins, then put 
                                    the pan under the grill for another 2 mins until the sides are puffed up and the 
                                    cheese has melted. Lift onto a board, drizzle with a little olive oil if you like, 
                                    then cut into wedges and serve while you make the next one.</li>
                            </ol>
