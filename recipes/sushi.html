                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cook Sushi Rice as per pack instructions.</li>
                            <li>Place a sushi mat onto a clean work surface with slats 
                            running horizontally. Place a seaweed sheet (shiny side down) on the mat.</li>
                            <li>Use wet hands to spread Â¾ cup of rice over the seaweed sheet, 
                            leaving a 3 cm wide border along the top edge.</li>
                        
                            <li>Combine the mayonnaise and wasabi in a bowl. Spread a little 
                            wasabi mayonnaise along the centre of the rice. Top with one salmon
                             strip and some sliced avocado. Pick up the edge of the mat closest to you. 
                             Hold filling in place while rolling the mat over to enclose rice and 
                             filling in to the seaweed.</li>
                        
                            <li>Repeat with the remaining seaweed sheets, rice and 
                            filling to make 5 more rolls.</li>
                        
                            <li>Cut sushi rolls into 2cm thick slices. Arrange on a platter 
                            and serve with soy sauce. Variations: Instead of salmon use cooked 
                            peeled prawns.</li>
